# Python_Learning

The purpose of this project is to practice and enhnace my skills at Python Pandas.
The project consists of several parts each of them is dedicated to a specific topic.
Each part has its own list of goals.

## PYTHON_PANDAS / Series, DataFrame       ----------------------------------------------------
### Series
- [x] create an empty series
- [x] create a series from a list with default/ and customized index
- [x] create a series from a dict with index 
- [] create a series from scalar, provide an index
- [x] access data  from series with position (iloc[] method)
- [x] access data from series using label (loc [] methond)
- [x] sort the dataframe asc/desc, by multiple columns 
- [x] sort the dataframe by multiple columns but different orders


- [x] compute summary statistics
- [x] compute the correlation
- [x] compute the numerical data ranks
- [] create plotting with Matplotlib


### DataFrame
## Section: DataFrame functions
- [] access a single value in a data frame or series using a row/column label pair / pandas.DataFrame.at()
- [] access a group of rows and columns by label(s) / pandas.DataFrame.loc()

## Section: Python_Numpy
- [] plot the data from .csv file (single graph)
- [] plot the data from .csv file (multiple graphs)
- [] plot the data from .csv file (skip the header)


## Section: Python_Matplotlib
-[] plot the dasta from csv file(singtle and multiple plots)
-[] create different types of plots(line, bar chart, area, pie, scatter 3D plot, histogram)
-[] create plotes with customized features(color, legend, markers, scale)

##  Section: Axes Operations on DataFrame 
- [x] operations (mean, min, max) on dataframe when axis = 0 
- [x] operations (mean, min, max) on dataframe whenk axiz = 1
- [] combine dataframes when axis = 0
- [] combine dataframes when axis = 1

## Section: Filter DataFrame
- [x] 1) dataframe way to filter a dataframe

- [x] 2) query function to filter a dataframe
    - [x] 2.1) one column/condition
    - [x] 2.2) multiple columns/conditions
    - [x] 2.3) reference method 
    - [x] 2.4) pass variables in query function
    - [x] 2.5) features inplace = False/True

- [x] 3) loc() function
- [x] 4) iloc() function
- [x] 5) filer dataframe by row and column position
- [x] 6) select rows whose column value != a specific value
- []  7) negate a column
- []  5) select non-missing values in data frame
- []  6) filter string in data frame
- []  7) filter if a column name has a space
